## What is Yai ?

`Yai` (your AI) is an assistant for your terminal, using OpenAI compatible APIs to build and run commands for you. You just need to describe them in your everyday language, it will take care or the rest.

You have any questions on random topics in mind? You can also ask `Yai`, and get the power of AI without leaving `/home`.

It is already aware of your:

- operating system & distribution
- username, shell & home directory
- preferred editor

And you can also give any supplementary preferences to fine tune your experience.
